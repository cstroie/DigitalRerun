# A private shelf

Software you may not share (the Infocom collections, WordStar, …) never goes into
this repository or the app. It lives in a **catalog** on your own web server; the
SHELF tab's *Private shelf* section points the app at it, and a disk is fetched
only when you insert it. Nothing is cached by the service worker.

## 1. Build the catalog

```
node tools/private-shelf.js <folder with the story files> <out> [--category=Infocom]
```

Every Z-machine story (`.z1`–`.z8`, or the `.dat` files of the DOS releases,
recognised by their header) under the source folder becomes a game disk in `<out>`:
the story, `VEZZA.COM`, `PLAY.COM`, `VEZZA.LIC` and a `README.TXT`, on the smallest
disk that holds it (8" 250K, 5¼" 400K, or a hard disk). `<out>/shelf.json` lists them.
Names come from the file names; an optional `<folder>/titles.json` names them:

```json
{ "zork1.dat": { "name": "Zork I", "description": "…", "category": "Infocom" } }
```

Software that is no story (WordStar, a compiler …) goes in `<folder>/disks/`: each
folder there becomes one disk of its files, as the app's FROM FOLDER makes it. The files
in it go to user 0, subfolders named `1` to `15` to those user areas, names CP/M cannot
hold are made 8.3 (the tool says which), text files get CP/M line ends, and the smallest
of the 8", 400K 5¼" and hard disk formats that holds it is used. `titles.json` names such
a disk by its folder's name, lower case: `"wordstar": { "name": "WordStar 4" }`.

Vezza reads Z-machine versions 1 to 8, so Z4 and Z5 stories are taken as well as Z3,
but only as far as a text console goes: the graphical version (6) will not run on
this machine. A large story (Trinity, A Mind Forever Voyaging) may need the 400K disk,
which the tool then chooses by itself. Only Z3 was tried here; if a Z4 or Z5 story
misbehaves, that is worth knowing.

`shelf.json` has the same shape as the shipped `disks/shelf.json`, with `image` (and
`format`) per disk, so a disk image you made yourself can be added by hand.

## 2. Serve it

Any static web server will do, as long as the app can reach it.

- **The app and the catalog on the same server** (say the catalog under `/games/`):
  nothing else is needed. Enter `/games/` as the address.
- **The app elsewhere** (GitHub Pages), the catalog on your own box: the catalog must
  be **https** with a certificate the browser trusts (a page served over https may not
  read plain http, except from `localhost`), and must allow the app's origin.

For a static server (lighttpd), allow the origin and keep the folder's name hard to guess:
without a token the browser sends a plain request and no preflight is needed.

```
server.modules += ( "mod_setenv" )
$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/games-7f3k9q/" {
    setenv.add-response-header = (
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" => "https://cstroie.github.io",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network" => "true",
        "Cache-Control" => "no-store"
    )
}
```

The app also sends a token (`Authorization: Bearer …`) when you enter one. That makes
the browser send a preflight (OPTIONS) first, which the server must answer `204` with
`Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization`, without the token. A plain static
server cannot do that; `tools/private-serve.js` can, and is also the quick way to try
a catalog:

```
node tools/private-serve.js <out> --port=8099 --token=secret [--origin=https://cstroie.github.io]
```

It speaks http: fine for `http://localhost`, not for anything else.

## 3. Connect the app

SHELF tab → *Private shelf*: the catalog's address (a folder, or the `.json`) and the
token if there is one → CONNECT. The address and token are kept in this browser
(`localStorage`) and the catalog is read again whenever the app opens; FORGET removes
both. A catalog that cannot be reached says so under the heading (address, https
certificate, CORS); the public shelf is unaffected.
