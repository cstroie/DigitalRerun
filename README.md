![DigitalRerun: the CP/M prompt, the drives and a page from the dot matrix printer](docs/screenshot.png)

</div>

DigitalRerun is a complete CP/M 2.2 machine that runs in a web page:
- a **Z80 with 64K** of RAM;
- **8" floppy drives** and a 4 MB hard disk;
- a **VT100** or **ADM-3A** console with a glowing phosphor screen;
- an **FX-80 dot matrix printer** that strikes its dots onto fanfold paper, tractor holes and all.

It is not a CP/M look-alike. The machine boots the **original CP/M 2.2 CCP and BDOS**, byte for byte as they shipped, read by a real BIOS from the system tracks of an 8" disk. Everything CP/M did then, it does here: `PIP`, `ED`, `ASM`, `DDT`, `SUBMIT`. You can even rebuild the BIOS inside CP/M with the 1980 recipe and boot the result.

It is a single web page with no dependencies, no build step and no server. It installs as an app, works offline, and keeps your disks and your place between visits.

## Why you'll like it

- **The real thing.** The original CP/M 2.2 system, assembled from source by the project's own assembler into exactly the binaries on the 1979 distribution disk. A test checks every byte.
- **A shelf of software.** Zork I, II and III, five more free text adventures, BBC BASIC with example programs, a public domain Forth-83 and two C compilers (BDS C and HI-TECH C), every one free to share and ready to insert into a drive. Your own disks (WordStar, MBASIC …) go on *My disks* and stay in your browser.
- **A printer you can watch.** PRTDEMO shows off pica, elite, condensed, bold, italic, underlined, enlarged, super- and subscript text and bit-image graphics. Save the pages as PNG or PDF.
- **Snapshots.** Freeze the whole machine (CPU, memory, screen and disks) and come back to that exact moment later, even mid-game. Leave the page and it resumes where you were.
- **Bring your own software.** Drop files onto the DRIVES panel to copy them to the selected drive, or LOAD a whole `.dsk` image into a drive. Disks use the standard 8" format of cpmtools and z80pack, plus the 5¼" ones below.
- **Hackable to the bone.** The BIOS, the boot loader and SYSGEN are short, commented 8080 sources on the boot disk. Change them with `ED`, assemble them with `ASM`, install them with `SYSGEN`.
- **It sounds right.** The bell, the clunk of an 8" drive loading its head, the clicks of the head stepping across tracks, and the rasp of the print head. All are synthesized, and a SETUP switch turns them off.
- **Screenshots.** SHOT saves the screen as a PNG, phosphor glow and scan lines included.
- **A debugger.** Registers and flags, a Z80 disassembly that follows the program, breakpoints, step and step over, and a memory view.
- **Phone friendly.** A key row adds what phone keyboards lack (CTRL, ESC, TAB, arrows, ^C), ADD FILES replaces drag and drop, the printed paper gets its own tab, and the 80 columns stay readable.
- **Paste a whole listing.** PASTE types at a careful typist's pace, waiting for the program to ask for each key, so nothing is lost, not even in programs that read the keyboard ahead.

## Try it

Open **https://cstroie.github.io/DigitalRerun/**, click the screen and type:

```
A>DIR                        what is on the disk
A>STAT B:                    room on the empty disk in B:
A>PIP B:=A:*.COM             copy the programs to B:
A>PRTDEMO                    print a page (see PAPER)
A>D:                         to the game disk
D>VEZZA ZORK1.Z3             and you are standing west of a white house
```

A: holds the CP/M 2.2 tools (PIP, STAT, ED, ASM, LOAD, DDT, SUBMIT, XSUB, DUMP), SYSGEN, PRTDEMO, and the sources of the BIOS, the loader and SYSGEN. B: holds an empty disk, and D: holds Zork I.

`^C` warm-starts the system, `^S` pauses the output and `^P` echoes the console to the printer. In Zork, `SAVE` and `RESTORE` keep your progress on the disk.

## What's inside

### The machine

| | |
|---|---|
| CPU | Z80, at 2, 4 or 8 MHz or as fast as the browser goes. It costs nothing while CP/M waits for a key. It passes all of ZEXDOC and 66 of the 67 ZEXALL tests. The one left checks the undocumented X and Y flags of `BIT n,(HL)`, which a real Z80 takes from its hidden MEMPTR register; no CP/M program depends on them |
| Memory | 64K RAM. CCP at `E400h`, BDOS at `EC00h`, BIOS at `FA00h` |
| A: to D: | 8" single-sided, single-density: 77 tracks of 26 × 128-byte sectors, skew 6, 2 system tracks, 241K (boots). Also three 5¼" double-density data formats: SSDD 200K and DSDD 400K with 512-byte sectors, and SSDD 200K with 1K sectors. All are raw images, compatible with cpmtools (`ibm-3740`, `kpii`, `kpiv`, `osborne1`: the Kaypro II, Kaypro 4 and Osborne 1 formats) and z80pack |
| I: | 4 MB hard disk, z80pack geometry |
| Console | VT100 (subset) or ADM-3A, chosen in SETUP; exactly 80 × 24 at any window size, green, amber or white phosphor; WordStar, VT100 or ADM-3A arrow keys. Typing reaches the machine wherever the focus is on the page (except form fields) |
| Printer | FX-80 compatible, on `LST:` |
| Lights | POWER, RUN (bright while working, dim while waiting), one per drive, PRN |

At reset, the "boot ROM" loads sector 1 of track 0 into `0000h` and jumps there. That sector is [`system/boot.asm`](system/boot.asm), which reads CCP, BDOS and BIOS from the system tracks and starts the BIOS. Nothing about CP/M is built into the emulator: the system is whatever the boot disk holds.

The I/O ports follow z80pack for the disk controller:

| Port | In | Out |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | console status: `0FFh` when a key waits | |
| 1 | console data | console data |
| 2 | printer status: `0FFh` when on line | |
| 3 | | printer data |
| 4 | paper tape reader: the next byte, `1Ah` when the tape has run out | |
| 5 | | paper tape punch |
| 10 | `0FFh` when the drive holds a disk | drive |
| 11, 12, 17 | | track; sector (low, high) |
| 15, 16 | | DMA address (low, high) |
| 13 | | command: 0 read, 1 write |
| 14 | status of the last command (0 = ok) | |
| 18 | the format of the disk in the selected drive (0 8", 1–3 the 5¼" ones, 4 hard disk) | |

### The shelf

The SHELF tab is the disk collection. INSERT puts a fresh copy into a drive: floppies into the one you choose, hard disks into I:. Then press `^C` so CP/M sees it.

| Disk | What it is | Try |
|---|---|---|
| CP/M 2.2 | the system disk | `DIR` |
| Zork I, II, III | the Infocom trilogy (MIT licence) and the Vezza interpreter | `PLAY` (or `VEZZA ZORK2.Z3`) |
| Colossal Cave, Moonglow, Cat's Eye, The Fantasy Dimension, Submarine Sabotage | five freeware Z3 adventures, one disk each | `PLAY` |
| Forth-83 (F83) | Laxen and Perry's Forth-83 (public domain), on a 400K disk with the kernel, extension and utility sources | `F83`, then `2 3 + .` |
| BBC BASIC (Z80) | R.T. Russell's BASIC (zlib licence), with MANDEL, PRIMES, GUESS and BANNER | `BBCBASIC`, `LOAD "PRIMES"`, `RUN` |
| BDS C 1.60 | the first C compiler for CP/M (public domain) | `CC HELLO`, `CLINK HELLO`, `HELLO` |
| HI-TECH C 3.09 | an ANSI C compiler, on a 4 MB hard disk for I: (free for any use) | `C -V HELLO.C`, `HELLO` |

Every game disk has a `PLAY` command that types the `VEZZA game.Z3` line for you. (CP/M 2.2 has no `.CMD` programs; `PLAY.COM` puts the command in the CCP's buffer and lets it run, as if you had typed it.) Only software that may be shared is on the shipped shelf. **My disks** holds your own: KEEP A DISK copies a drive's disk there, and IMPORT .DSK adds an image from your device. They are kept in this browser only, so software you own but may not share (WordStar, MBASIC, Turbo Pascal) never leaves your devices. Each shelf disk is built from its files when you insert it (`disks/shelf/`, listed in `disks/shelf.json` by `tools/build.js`), and the app keeps the files for offline use.

### The panels

On a desktop the window is the machine, with no page to scroll:
- **Top right:** the front strip, above the side panels: the lights and the speed readout, then the clock, PASTE, PAPER, SHOT (a PNG of the screen), SNAP and RESET.
- **Left:** the screen, as large as the window allows at 80 × 24 and in its proportions.
- **Right:** tabs for DRIVES, SHELF, PRINTER, SETUP and DEBUG. Only the panel under them scrolls.

**The paper** is a drawer over the screen. While something prints it stays shut: the PRN led lights. PAPER opens the drawer, at the top of the paper (a clean sheet if nothing was printed yet), with FF, TEAR OFF, PNG, PRINT and ✕ to go back. The machine keeps running underneath.

On a phone the page scrolls instead, and the paper is the PAPER tab.

### The console

SETUP chooses the terminal: **VT100** (the default) or **ADM-3A**. Install your programs for the same one; WordStar, Turbo Pascal and most CP/M software list both. You can switch at any time, and the screen is kept.

- **VT100:** cursor moves and addressing, erasing, bold, dim, underline, blink and reverse video, scroll regions, inserting and deleting lines and characters, and cursor and status reports.
- **ADM-3A:** `ESC =` cursor addressing, `^Z` clear, `^^` home, and `^H ^J ^K ^L` moves. The 80th character wraps at once, as on the real terminal. It also accepts the extensions that later ADM-compatible terminals added and many CP/M programs send:
  - `ESC T` / `ESC Y` erase to the end of the line or the screen;
  - `ESC *` clears the screen;
  - `ESC E` / `ESC R` insert or delete a line;
  - `ESC Q` / `ESC W` insert or delete a character;
  - `ESC )` / `ESC (` half intensity;
  - `ESC G n` and `ESC B n` / `ESC C n` attributes.

The arrow keys send WordStar's `^E ^X ^S ^D`, VT100's `ESC [ A …` or ADM-3A's `^K ^J ^H ^L`. Terminal arrow keys follow the terminal when you switch.

### The debugger

The DEBUG tab shows the registers and flags, a disassembly from the program counter (or any address you type), and memory as hex and ASCII.

- **Breakpoints:** click a line of code to set or clear one. The machine pauses when it gets there.
- **Controls:**
  - PAUSE stops the CPU anywhere, and CONTINUE lets it go on;
  - STEP runs one instruction;
  - OVER runs a CALL or RST through to the instruction after it.

The disassembler ([`js/disz80.js`](js/disz80.js)) knows every Z80 opcode, the undocumented ones included, in Zilog mnemonics. While the machine runs, the panel follows it four times a second.

### Drives and files

- **ADD FILES** (or dropping files on the DRIVES panel) copies them to the selected drive. Then press `^C`, so CP/M logs the disk in again.
- Click a file to download it. Text files (`.ASM`, `.TXT`, `.SUB` …) are converted between LF and CP/M's CR LF on the way in and out.
- Each drive has these buttons:
  - **LOAD** inserts a `.dsk` image of any of the formats. The two 200K formats share a size, so LOAD reads the directory to tell which it is;
  - **SAVE** downloads one;
  - An **AltairZ80** image (1,113,536 bytes: 254 tracks of 32 × 137-byte sectors) is no disk of this machine, so LOAD copies its files onto the disk in that drive, or onto a new blank disk (4 MB on I:, 400K on a floppy drive) if it is empty. Load it on I: when it holds more than a floppy does;
  - **NEW** asks for a label and a format, and inserts a blank disk (an 8" one is bootable);
  - **SYS** writes a system tracks image onto a disk.
- Disks are kept in the browser (IndexedDB), and they are still there tomorrow.
- **Paper tape.** LOAD TAPE puts a file from your device in the reader, and `PIP FILE.TXT=RDR:` reads it in. `PIP PUN:=FILE.TXT` punches a file, and SAVE TAPE downloads it, with PIP's leader nulls and closing `^Z` trimmed. Text gets CP/M's line ends on the way in and yours on the way out.

### Changing the system, the 1980 way

The BIOS ([`system/bios.asm`](system/bios.asm)) is 8080 code in the syntax of CP/M's own `ASM.COM`. Change it inside CP/M:

```
A>ED BIOS.ASM                 change it
A>SYSGEN                      source A, RETURN; destination RETURN (the image stays in memory)
A>SAVE 34 CPM64.COM
A>ASM BIOS
A>DDT CPM64.COM
-IBIOS.HEX
-R2580                        the BIOS runs at FA00h; in the image it sits at 1F80h
-G0
A>SYSGEN                      source RETURN (use memory), destination A
```

Then press RESET and your BIOS boots. In the SYSGEN image the loader sits at `0900h`, the CCP at `0980h`, the BDOS at `1180h` and the BIOS at `1F80h`, so the same recipe also swaps in another CCP or BDOS (ZCPR, ZSDOS …).

On the host, `node tools/build.js` assembles everything with [`js/asm8080.js`](js/asm8080.js), a two-pass 8080 assembler that reads both the ASM.COM and the Macro Assembler AS dialects. It writes `system/cpm22.bin` (the system tracks), `disks/cpm22.dsk` and `disks/zork1.dsk`.

### The printer

The FX-80 strikes dots from its own 9-pin font onto 9½" fanfold sheets. From the PRINTER panel you can download the sheets as PNG or print them (or save as PDF), and TEAR OFF starts a fresh sheet. It understands:

- CR, LF, FF, BS, HT;
- SO/DC4 (enlarged for one line), SI/DC2 (condensed);
- `ESC E/F` emphasized, `ESC G/H` double-strike, `ESC 4/5` italic, `ESC -` underline;
- `ESC W` enlarged, `ESC S/T` super- and subscript, `ESC M/P` elite and pica, `ESC !` master select;
- `ESC 0 1 2 3 A J` line spacing;
- `ESC C N O` form length and skipping the perforation;
- `ESC D` tabs, `ESC l Q` margins;
- `ESC K L Y Z *` bit images;
- `ESC @` reset;
- codes `80h`–`FFh`, which print in italics.

Other sequences are skipped together with their parameters.

### Snapshots

A snapshot is the whole machine at one moment: CPU, memory, screen, printer head, and a copy of every disk, so memory and disks always agree.

- **SNAP** (next to RESET) or **SAVE SNAPSHOT** (in SETUP) keeps one, up to twelve. Each shows its time and the last line on the screen.
- **RESTORE** goes back to that moment, even in the middle of a program or a game.
- With *Save when I leave, and resume there* on (the default), an automatic snapshot is also kept. It is saved when the page is hidden or closed, when the window loses focus, and once a minute while the machine works. The next visit continues where you left off.

The printed paper is not part of a snapshot.

### As an app

DigitalRerun is a progressive web app:

- **Install.** Where the browser can install apps, a banner offers INSTALL. On an iPhone or iPad it explains *Share, then Add to Home Screen*.
- **Offline.** After the first visit everything is kept, the disks included, and the app starts with no network.
- **Updates.** A new version downloads in the background. A banner names it and offers RELOAD; your disks are saved first. SETUP shows the running version and has CHECK FOR UPDATES.

## For developers

```
git clone https://github.com/cstroie/DigitalRerun.git
cd DigitalRerun
python3 -m http.server 8000         # any static server; then open http://localhost:8000
node --test                         # 68 tests: assembler, file system, Altair images, terminal, printer, CP/M, snapshots, PWA
ZEX=1 node --test test/zex.test.js  # ZEXDOC on the Z80 core (a few minutes; ZEX=all adds ZEXALL, CI runs both)
```

The machine tests boot the real disk and type at the CCP. They cover:
- `DIR`, `STAT`, `PIP`, `ASM`, printing and `SYSGEN`;
- the whole change-the-BIOS recipe above;
- Zork;
- restoring snapshots.

Releasing a change: raise `VERSION` in [`js/version.js`](js/version.js) and run `node tools/stamp.js`. The build stamp is a hash of every file the app keeps offline, and a test fails when it is stale.
